Removed the hardcoded UIImageViews created in Interface Builder and replaced with images created programmatically.

The code that changed is CoolrSwapViewController.m. There are two types of object created:
- the images created in initImages()
- the squares (UIImageView) showing images on screen, in initSquares()

The init functions mentioned above are created in the method viewDidLoad. As the name implies the viewDidLoad method is called automatically by
the iPhone framework when the view did load.

The number of rows and columns is defined by the defines NB_ROWS, NB_COLS. The layout of the squares is defined by the SQ_* defines.

There are 2 instance variables that hold the array of images (red, green, blue) and the list of onscreen views that display images. These are released in dealloc(). 
Note that each UIImageView is released after being added to the view.
